Featuring the 1905 church organ at First United Methodist Church in Kane, PA and organist of over 50 years, Debbie Airgood. Debbie talks about the history and mechanical components of this organ. She also takes us into the \"heart\" of the organ...both physically into the inner chamber and spiritually as she plays unto the Lord. The documentary culminates in a performance of her favorite piece.",
